In this repository the two models for the Master thesis _Estimation of energy production from roof and wall mounted solar panels in Longyearbyen (Svalbard)_ are published in order to follow the different steps which were undertaken in this model to match the AC measurements. For further scripts regarding the pre-processing of data or for any further questions, please contact Kim Cholibois (kimcholibois@icloud.com).
